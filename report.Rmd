# Elk Expeditions: The Elk, the Environment, and the Evolving Migration in Yellowstone

The written report produced by your team is central to this project. This will detail how you completed your project, and should cover data collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies, descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We anticipate that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the reasons for them should be documented! You will write one report document per group, and be sure to include all group member names in the document.

Your report should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

## Motivation

Our project explores the dynamics of elk migration in the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Park. Inspired by our visits to national parks and our love for wildlife, we embarked on this project to combine interests in wildlife, the environment and our new found data science skills. Utilizing R's mapping capabilities, particularly the leaflet package, we aimed to create an interactive platform to visualize and analyze elk movement patterns.

To enrich our analysis, we incorporated complementary datasets on weather, land cover, and water quality, enabling us to investigate how these environmental factors influence elk migration. Additionally, we explored temporal patterns, examining variations in migration year-over-year and across different seasons. This multidimensional approach allowed us to gain deeper insights into the behavior of these iconic animals and how they interact with their environment.

Through this project, we aimed not only to advance our technical expertise but also to foster appreciation and understanding of the intricate natural processes that unfold in these beloved landscapes.

## Related work

Wildlife in Yellowstone peaked our interest largely due to the fact that its natural geography is so odd. It is laid on top of a *supervolcano* with many areas bubbling and boiling. While visiting the park this summer, we learned an odd fact that the biodiversity has suffered much less loss than neighboring areas and much of the world. This is largely why we wanted to study the animal movement and see if other environmental factors have affected migration patterns. 

## Questions

What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

Initial questions we had about the elk migration were:

1.  Where do the elk move around in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons National Parks?
2.  Do the elk that are collared with GPS signal move individually or as a pack?
3.  How does elk movement change over time of year and year to year.
4.  How do environmental factors such as weather, land cover, soil chemistry, and soil temperature affect the elk's migration patterns?

As the analysis evolved, we realized some data sources were more applicable than others. Some did not have enough data points or were not in the geographically area that we were interested in. Additional questions that we asked were:

1.  Does temperature affect the distance traveled by the elk? What about rainfall, snowfall, and snow depth?
2.  Does water quality factors, such as arsenic levels, affect the movement of the elk?

## Data

The elk data used in this project was provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which utilized GPS collar tracking in the National Elk Rescue area near Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, from 2006 to 2015. The data was comprised on 17 adult female elk, each of which had their daily locations tracked for 1-2 years. From this data source, we were able to map the pathways of each elk over time, which also allowed us to calculate the daily distance traveled among the elk subjects. 

Land cover data, also provided by USGS, was presented as a raster dataset that shows the distribution of vegetation, water, and bare rock throughout the study area in 2011, which falls near the midpoint of the 2006-2015 study period of this project. The data was presented by the GAP Analysis Project in Wyoming in 2019, and we were able to transform the raster data into their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates, which allowed us to layer the elk migration pathways on top of the land cover data. 

Weather data, provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), featured daily weather station recordings (from 2006-2015) at four different stations that fell within the elk migration pathways and spanned wide portions of the study area. We primarily focused on total precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and average temperature. 

Water quality data was obtained from datasets provided by the National Park Service, and featured water sample measurements containing various concentrations of water contaminants, such as arsenic, chloride, and magnesium, as well as other properties, such as dissolved oxygen content and pH. Among the water sampling sites considered, this project focused on data collected at two sites that fell within the migration pathways: `GRTE_SNR01` and `GRTE_SNR02`. 

## Exploratory analysis

Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

## Additional analysis

If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

## Discussion

What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your report is a standalone document that fully describes your process and results. We also expect you to write high-quality code that is understandable to an outside reader. Coding collaboratively and actively reviewing code within the team will help with this!
