# Elk Expeditions: The Elk, the Environment, and the Evolving Migration in Yellowstone  

### Motivation  

Our project explores the dynamics of elk migration in the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Park. Inspired by our visits to national parks and our love for wildlife, we embarked on this project to combine interests in wildlife, the environment and our new found data science skills. Utilizing R's mapping capabilities, particularly the leaflet package, we aimed to create an interactive platform to visualize and analyze elk movement patterns.

To enrich our analysis, we incorporated complementary data sets on weather, land cover, and water quality, enabling us to investigate how these environmental factors influence elk migration. We explored temporal patterns, examining variations in migration year-over-year and across different seasons. This multidimensional approach allowed us to gain deeper insights into the behavior of these iconic animals and how they interact with their environment.

Through this project, we aimed not only to advance our technical expertise but also to foster appreciation and understanding of the intricate natural processes that unfold in these beloved landscapes.

### Related work  

Wildlife in Yellowstone peaked our interest largely due to the fact that its natural geography is so odd. It is laid on top of a *supervolcano* with many areas bubbling and boiling. While visiting the park this summer, we learned an odd fact that the biodiversity has suffered much less loss than neighboring areas and much of the world. This is largely why we wanted to study the animal movement and see if other environmental factors have affected migration patterns. 

### Questions  

Initial questions we had about the elk migration were:  

1.  Where do the elk move around in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons National Parks?  
2.  Do the elk that are collared with GPS signal move individually or as a pack?  
3.  How does elk movement change over time of year and year to year.  
4.  How do environmental factors such as weather, land cover, soil chemistry, and soil temperature affect the elk's migration patterns?  

As the analysis evolved, we realized some data sources were more applicable than others. Some did not have enough data points or were not in the geographically area that we were interested in. Additional questions that we asked were:  

1.  Does temperature affect the distance traveled by the elk? What about rainfall, snowfall, and snow depth?  
2.  Does water quality factors, such as arsenic levels, affect the movement of the elk?  

### Data  

The elk data used in this project was provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which utilized GPS collar tracking in the National Elk Rescue area near Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, from 2006 to 2015. The data was comprised on 17 adult female elk, each of which had their daily locations tracked for 1-2 years. From this data source, we were able to map the pathways of each elk over time, which also allowed us to calculate the daily distance traveled among the elk subjects.  

Land cover data, also provided by USGS, was presented as a raster dataset that shows the distribution of vegetation, water, and bare rock throughout the study area in 2011, which falls near the midpoint of the 2006-2015 study period of this project. The data was presented by the GAP Analysis Project in Wyoming in 2019, and we were able to transform the raster data into their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates, which allowed us to layer the elk migration pathways on top of the land cover data.  

Weather data, provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), featured daily weather station recordings (from 2006-2015) at four different stations that fell within the elk migration pathways and spanned wide portions of the study area. We primarily focused on total precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and average temperature.  

Water quality data was obtained from datasets provided by the National Park Service, and featured water sample measurements containing various concentrations of water contaminants, such as arsenic, chloride, and magnesium, as well as other properties, such as dissolved oxygen content and pH. Among the water sampling sites considered, this project focused on data collected at two sites that fell within the migration pathways: `GRTE_SNR01` and `GRTE_SNR02`.  

### Exploratory analysis  


### Additional analysis  

Beyond the visualizations and analyses presented in the exploratory analysis, this project also featured some additional forms of analysis, particularly regarding the water quality data and its potential impact on the elk subjects. After compiling and visualizing the data pertaining to water contaminants (e.g., chloride, magnesium, phosphorous) and other properties (e.g., dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH), we were able to assess the potential impacts that these toxicant concentrations could have on the health of the elk subjects. 

### Discussion

**Elk Migration Characteristics**

Once the elk migration data was cleaned and transformed, we explored migration patterns using time points, latitude, and longitude values. Analyzing data for 17 elk revealed that not all time points were consistently available for every individual. To assess the range of movement, we examined latitude and longitude ranges, identifying elk 917 as the top explorer. Monthly movements were compared by year, alongside daily averages, which typically hovered around 4 km, though some days showed much greater distances.

For better comparisons, we focused on eight elk with overlapping data between July 2013 and December 2014. Within this timeframe, we examined seasonal impacts on movement, noting spikes in May and December. To ensure data consistency, we checked whether the number of data points influenced total distance but found no significant issues, allowing us to proceed with raw distance data in kilometers. Finally, we used `leaflet` to map elk movements for May and December, showing start and endpoints as well as color-coded paths. Users can explore additional months and years or check water quality measures for corresponding time points through the interactive elk dashboard.

**Land Cover**

Once the land cover data was converted to its corresponding latitude and longitude and layered with the distribution of elk migration, we were able to visualize the distribution of land cover (in terms of vegetation abundance). When visualizing the entire study area, we found that 137 was the most common land cover value, and this corresponds to sparse vegetation such as areas of bare rock (on a scale with a maximum of 583, which represents land covered by water). The second most common value was 500, which corresponded to abundant vegetation.  

After plotting the distribution of land cover values in the areas traveled through by elk, we revealed that this time the most frequent land cover values were between 300 and 500, indicating medium to high levels of vegetation. This trend seems appropriate given that elk are herbivorous grazers, as well as the fact that abundant vegetation can also provide necessary shade on warmer, sunny days.  

In an attempt to visualize the migration habits of elk based on different land cover types, we divided the relative elk density by land cover value, revealing that the land cover values most frequented by the elk were between ~320-500, or medium to high vegetation.

**Water Quality**

We discovered that among the results of the water quality visualizations was that high arsenic concentrations were reported in July and August of 2010 in the sampling site `GRTE_SNR01`. At this site around the same time as when these arsenic measurements were recorded, we also saw that two elk had traveled around this sampling site, potentially being exposed to unhealthy levels of arsenic in water. Other notable markers of poor water quality that we observed included low dissolved oxygen concentrations in June and July of 2010, as well as relatively high chloride levels in October of 2010, a chemical that could also indicate the presence of lead in water, which has no safe concentration for exposure. Users can explore the water quality and corresponding elk movement on the elk dashboard.
